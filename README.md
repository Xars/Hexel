Hexel
=====

A voxel based exploration game

goals:
-----

* use cellular automata to create a dynamic and unpredictable environment
* implement a world generator that creates highly appealing terrain
* allow players to, if they desire, always move towards increasingly dangerous situations

install with maven
-----
The project is now mavenised. To run using maven use:
	 
	 MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m mvn install exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Hexel.Hexel"

To prepare the project as an eclipse project try:

	mvn install eclipse:eclipse

This should make the game more likely to "work out of the box"
